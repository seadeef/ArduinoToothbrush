# ArduinoToothbrush

Arduino microprocessor code to control the pitch of two toothbrushes programmatically. 

## Code
Tone constants are hand-tuned in `tones1.h` and `tones2.h`, and are specific to each toothbrush. `play_toothbrush.ino` contains the logic to schedule notes on two toothbrushes at once, and uses the melody and rhythm globally defined in the file.
